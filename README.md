##Building and Running

Required software:

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

First install dependencies in the working directory with `npm install`. This will also install elm.

Run `npm run start` to build the project and serve it locally while watching for changes. Elm dependencies will also be installed into the working directory during the build phase.
